# Basic firmware

The base firmware acts as a fundamental version that contains all the elements needed to work optimally with the ecosystem.
To create a custom version with a custom circuit board, it is necessary to create a fork of this repository.
In this way, the basic model remains intact and can be improved over time without affecting previous projects.
